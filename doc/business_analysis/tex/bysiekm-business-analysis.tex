\section*{Abstract}

This document describes a business analysis (problem analysis and requirements specification) of a
planned application called \titletext. This application is aimed at introducing the user to the
world of regular expressions\textsuperscript{\cite{wiki_rl}} and finite-state
machines\textsuperscript{\cite{wiki_fsm}} (i.e. the theoretical constructs that let us evaluate
regular expressions). The application will consist of GUI (graphical user interface) coupled with a
regular expression evaluation engine. Together these two components will enable the user to enter an
expression by hand (or, alternatively, load it from plain text file) and then semi-automatically
construct a finite-state machine that is equivalent to this expression. In other words, given
regular expression expands into the same set of words that a resulting finite-state machine accepts.

\section{Feature overview}
In this section, reader is presented with the features that must be implemented, unless a given
feature is explicitly labeled as: optional, not mandatory, etc. The application will fulfill the
requirements if it implements all of the given features, unless those features are impossible to
implement while meeting the application environment constraints.

\subsection{Input methods}
Some definitions are vital in proper understanding of the calculation methods described below, and
in proper understanding of the requirements.

\subsubsection*{Definition}
\begin{itemize}

  \item \textit{input data} is a sequence of characters, which can be converted to a valid regular
  expression without ambiguity, and without user interaction.

\end{itemize}

Those characters must be writable with regular plain text editor. Moreover, the input data should,
unless it is impossible in certain cases, be visually similar to a regular expression that is
written without plain text editor. Using \LaTeX{} math mode syntax is preferred, but not
mandatory.

Ex. ``\verb|ab^*|'' may represent $ab^*$, and \verb|(ab)*(| may represent $(ab)\ast($ i.e. a word
in which parentheses and other special characters denote letters. The latter example is ambiguous,
because it either prevents user from using parentheses at all, or parentheses may mean different
things depending on entered regular expression. Such situation is unacceptable, because any
scheme in which characters have different meaning depending on context is ambiguous.

\subsubsection*{Requirements}

The user shall be able to enter the regular expression using at least
% three
two methods described below:
\begin{itemize}

  \item \textit{direct input} - user writes the expression into a single- or multi-line plain text
  field in the GUI.

  %\item load from plain text file

  \item \textit{example selection} -  user selects expression from a list of predefined expressions.
  There should be at least 10 example expressions, and they (globally) have to show usage of:
  \begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]

    \item \textit{empty word}, ex. $\epsilon$

    \item \textit{concatenation}, ex. $ab$ is a concatenation of $a$ and $b$

    \item \textit{union}, ex. $a+b$, which generates $a$ and $b$, and is equivalent to $b+a$

    \item \textit{Kleene star}\textsuperscript{\cite{wiki_kleenestar}}, ex. $a^*$, which generates a
    set of concatenations of $a$ with itself $n \in \mathbb{N}\cup\{0\}$ times, and is equivalent to
    $\epsilon+a^+$

    \item \textit{Kleene plus}\textsuperscript{\cite{wiki_kleenestar}}, ex. $a^+$, which generates a
    set of concatenations of $a$ with itself $n \in \mathbb{N}\backslash\{0\}$ times, and is
    equivalent to $aa^*$

    \item \textit{precedence of operators} (i.e. the use of parentheses and/or their absence), ex.
    $ab^+$, is equivalent to $abb^*$, but $(ab)^+$ is equiv. to $ab(ab)^*$

  \end{itemize}
  
  The selected example expression is loaded into the text field mentioned in the first input method,
  overwriting any previous input.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Input editing methods}
The user will be able to edit the expression regardless of what the input method was, before he/she
proceeds with calculations. Editing the input is to be done via a plain text field in the GUI.

\subsection{Calculation methods}

\subsubsection*{Definitions}
\begin{itemize}%[noitemsep,nolistsep]

  \item \textit{one step of computation} is a smallest step that can be taken from the algorithm
  used to complete calculations (in this case it is to find finite-state machine equivalent to the
  given regular expression).

  \item \textit{visualisation of current status of computation} consists of two tables that
  represent (respectively) the labeling and derivation process undertaken by the program (see
  section~\ref{sec:solutionprocess} for details regarding labeling and derivation process).

\end{itemize}

The first tables shows all currently labeled and not labeled symbols, therefore has to have at least
two columns: regular expression, and label. When second field is empty then the expression is not
labeled. If the algorithm is currently in labeling phase, the currently evaluated non-labeled
expression is highlighted.

The second table has at list three columns: initial expression, subtracted symbol, resulting
expression. If the algorithm is currently in derivation phase, the currently derived expression is
highlighted.

Highlighting means that the background color of a cell in which a highlighted content resides is
changed to the font color, and the font color is changed to the background color.

\subsubsection*{Requirements}
The user will be able to convert the entered expression to an equivalent finite-state machine using
two methods:
\begin{itemize}

  \item \textit{immediate result method}: will proceed with calculations up to the moment when user
  interaction is necessary, and will show visualisation of current status of computation only in
  such situation. After such pause, when the user decides to end interaction, he/she will click a
  button that will cause the computation to continue.
  
  This method completes when there are no intermediate steps that need user interaction and the
  final result is presented in the GUI.

  \item \textit{step-by-step method}: will perform one step of computation and present visualisation
  of current status of computation to the user. At that point the user can choose whether he/she
  would like to:
  
  \begin{itemize}

    \item proceed with the next step of computation

    \item abort computation, effectively reverting to the beginning

    \item proceed with the computation using \textit{immediate result method}, starting from the
    current position

  \end{itemize}
  
  This method completes when there are no more steps needed to obtain the final result.
  
  In this method, user still might be obliged to perform some actions in between steps, as it is
  possible in case of \textit{immediate result method}. In such cases, the 3 options for typical
  continuation shall be disabled, and only after the user indicates that the intermediate
  interaction is finished, they are enabled again and the user may choose further course of action.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Output analysis methods}

\subsubsection*{Definition}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]

  \item \textit{final result} is a two-dimensional directed graph with labeled edges. It is a
  graphical representation of a finite state machine constructed.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Requirements}
Final result has to conform with several constraints, most of which follow directly from the
convention regarding drawing finite-state machines:
\begin{itemize}

  \item all vertices, letters and edges on the graph have to be black and the background has to be
  white

  \item the vertices have to be black circles, and those representing accepting states have to have
  another black circle inside

  \item the initial state has to have index $0$ ex. it can be $q_0$, $s_0$, $r_0$, \ldots

  \item the edges leading to the rejecting state should be omitted for better readability, and the
  rejecting state is not to be drawn at all

  \item the drawing has to be readable, i.e. font size used has to be at least 10 points.

\end{itemize}

\section{Workflow with example}
The computation process used by the application shall follow the following outline. Solutions to two
sub-problems:
\begin{itemize}

  \item determining if some regular expression is equivalent to some other expression

  \item determining whether some regular expression can generate an empty word

\end{itemize}

\ldots do not have to be implemented, and can be left out for the user interaction. However, when
algorithm requires user interaction, it has to stop and show to the user all the needed information
so that he/she can really perform a task using only data provided by the application. The
development team is free to choose at which steps the the algorithm will be interactive.

\subsection{Input}
Input is in every case a valid regular expression. Further steps cannot be performed until the given
input satisfies validity criterion.

Example input:
\begin{gather*}
a^+c^+ + ab^+c
\end{gather*}

This expression represents a following set of words:
\begin{gather*}
L = \left\{ ac, aac, aaac, aaaac, \ldots \right\} %\cup \\
\cup \left\{ acc, aacc, aaacc, aaaacc, \ldots \right\} %\cup \\
\cup \left\{ accc, aaccc, aaaccc, aaaaccc, \ldots \right\} \cup \\
\cup \left\{ acccc, aacccc, aaacccc, aaaacccc, \ldots \right\} %\cup \\
\cup \ldots %\cup \\
\cup \left\{ abc, abbc, abbbc, abbbbc, \ldots \right\}
\end{gather*}

\subsection{Task}
Task is the same for every input: ``construct a finite-state machine equivalent to a given regular
expression''.

\subsection{Solution process}
\label{sec:solutionprocess}
In this part FSM is used as an acronym for finite-state machine.

\subsubsection{Step 0}
\label{sec:step0}

\subsubsection*{Labeling, step $0_L$}
At first we label our input as an initial state of the FSM:
\begin{gather*}
a^+c^+ + ab^+c = q_0
\end{gather*}

\subsubsection*{Derivation, step $0_D$}
Then, we try to derive all states of FSM that can be reached from our initial state in one
transition.

$e / x$ means that we try to construct from expression $e$ a new  expression without initial symbol
$x$, provided that such expression exists. If it does not, the result is the empty set:
\begin{gather*}
q_0 / a = a^*c^+ + b^+c \\
q_0 / b = \emptyset \\
q_0 / c = \emptyset
\end{gather*}

\subsubsection{Steps 1 to N+1}

\paragraph{Labeling, step $1_L$}
In each of these steps we at first label all results from the last step as new states of the FSM,
unless the equivalent expressions were previously encountered and are already labeled.
\begin{gather*}
a^*c^+ + b^+c = q_1
\end{gather*}

\paragraph{Derivation, step $1_D$}
Then we take the first unresolved state from the list of labeled states and we perform the same
operation as in Step $0_D$ (described in point~\ref{sec:step0}):
\begin{gather*}
q_1 / a = a^*c^+ \; , \;
q_1 / b = b^*c \; , \;
q_1 / c = c^*
\end{gather*}

\begin{multicols}{2}

\paragraph{Labeling, step $2_L$} $a^*c^+ = q_2$, $b^*c = q_3$, $c^* = q_4$

\paragraph{Derivation, step $2_D$} $q_2 / a = a^*c^+$, $q_2 / b = \emptyset$, $q_2 / c = c^*$

\paragraph{Step $3_L$} $a^*c^+$ and $c^*$ are already labeled

\paragraph{Step $3_D$} $q_3 / a = \emptyset$, $q_3 / b = b^*c$, $q_3 / c = \epsilon$

\paragraph{Step $4_L$} $b^*c$ is already labeled, $\epsilon = q_5$

\paragraph{Step $4_D$} $q_4 / a = \emptyset$, $q_4 / b = \emptyset$, $q_4 / c = c^*$

\paragraph{Step $5_L$} $c^*$ is already labeled

\paragraph{Step $5_D$} $q_5 / a = \emptyset$, $q_5 / b = \emptyset$, $q_5 / c = \emptyset$

\paragraph{Step $6_L$} There are no states to label in this step. There may be some unresolved
states, therefore we cannot end computation at this moment.

\paragraph{Step $6_D$} There are no more unresolved states, the algorithm moves to the next stage.

\end{multicols}

\subsubsection{Step N+2}
After derivation from all states (total number of states of the resulting FSM is $N+1$), each state
is evaluated and it is determined if an expression equivalent to the state can generate an empty
word ($\epsilon$). If yes, such state is added to the set of accepting states. Initial state can
also be an accepting state. There can be only one initial state, but multiple accepting states are
possible.

In our example $c^* = q_4$ and $\epsilon = q_5$, therefore $Q_A = \{ q_4, q_5 \}$
 
There is a special case, an empty state, which is the rejecting state. There is only one rejecting
state.

\subsection{Final result}
Final result is a transformation of a record of computation process into a graph that represents it.
\begin{gather*}
\begin{cases}
q_0 / a = q_1 \\
q_0 / b = \emptyset \\
q_0 / c = \emptyset
\end{cases}
\mbox{ is transformed into }
\begin{cases}
q_0 \overset{a}{\rightarrow} q_1 \\
q_0 \overset{b}{\rightarrow} \emptyset \\
q_0 \overset{c}{\rightarrow} \emptyset
\end{cases}
\end{gather*}

Analogously, every other derivation that happened in the steps $1_D \ldots N_D$ is transformed in
the same way. After all derivations are transformed a graph is drawn in the GUI.

Rules regarding the graph are as follows:
\begin{itemize}

  \item states $q_0, q_1, \ldots, q_n$ become the set of vertices

  \item transition $q_i \overset{x}{\rightarrow} q_j$ becomes a labeled and directed edge from vertex $q_i$ to
  vertex $q_j$, with label ``$x$''

\end{itemize}

This concludes a complete computation process.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{../../graphics/PhiniteGuiMockup.png}
  \caption{schema of the graphical user interface}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Main menu}
Main menu contains all general options that are required to be implemented, but are not connected
with a specific step of calculation. Contents of the menu must not change during application
operation, but its certain entries may be temporarily disabled during some phases of computation.

Main menu will contain, ex. exit option, %load option, 
example selection option.

\subsection{Main area}
Main area will contain frequently changing content, as it may have any of the following: a text
field for entering a regular expression, button to proceed to the next step of computation, button
to abort computation, button to display final result, a table with intermediate results, a final
result, etc. Content of main area depends on context, i.e. previous actions of the user and current
status of application.

\subsection{Status bar}
Status bar must contain one of three phrases at all times, unless there are equivalent indicators
implemented (mentioned in each point):
\begin{itemize}

  \item ``busy'' - if program computes the final or intermediate result. %, or is loading data.
  
  Equivalent of this is locking all elements of the GUI while the program is busy.

  \item ``awaiting user interaction'' - if program is not busy, but intends to be right after user
  gives some information that may help with further computation. The phrase may be changed to other
  with the same meaning. This status is intended only for computation phase, and only for those
  parts of computation phase that require user input.
  
  Equivalent of this status is displaying a new window. All information and input fields needed by
  the user to help the program must be in this new window. When it is closed, program resumes
  computation.
  
  Since the user feedback mechanism is optional (provided that it is of course substituted with
  working implementation), in certain implementation scenarios this status will never occur (or
  window will never be shown). If development team is able to prove that this feature would really
  never be used, this status indication does not have to be implemented.

  \item ``ready'' - in all other situations, for example: after start-up, %after loading the data,
  after completing the computation.
  
  Equivalent of this status is a situation in which both previous mechanisms are implemented using
  second variant. If it is so, this status can be omitted.

\end{itemize}

Status bar may also temporarily contain some optional content that may help the user in completing
the user interaction phase, provided that the main area is not a proper place for this content.

\section{Use cases}

Below is the diagram that puts the given requirements into a UML diagram. Division of the
application into two parts as pictured is a recommendation. Input/output handler is meant to
comprise the features related to getting the regular expression from the user, validating it, and
also displaying the final result. Computing process is meant to handle conversion related
calculations, without direct input from the user, but is able to receive suggestions regarding
computation form him/her.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../../use_case/use_cases.pdf}
  \caption{UML use case diagram for \titletext{} user}
\end{figure}

\section{Exception handling}
The theoretical background behind the concept of regular languages is very well established. This
application will therefore implement no experimental features, and undefined behaviour is strictly
forbidden.

The exception from this rule is a situation in which user input is needed during computation (there
are two cases), and the amount of work the user has to do in order to submit his/her help is lowered
due to some supporting experimental features, that may not always work, but sometimes help the user.
Such solutions will be considered an advantage, but are not a must.

In order to ensure that the computation will proceed as expected, application will perform
validation of input. Such validation does not have to be performed on per-character-written basis.
It is required for the program to validate input when user attempts to commence computation. At this
point, if the validation fails, either:

\begin{itemize}

  \item a dialog is presented with information about this fact,

  \item or text box with the input data is highlighted by changing its border to red line that has
  width between 2 and 5 pixels; and text informing the user about the error is added to the status
  bar.

\end{itemize}

Program will prohibit user from changing input data after the computation has started. Editing
capabilities will be restored after the computation has finished, or after the user aborts current
computation before it has concluded and the final solution is presented.
