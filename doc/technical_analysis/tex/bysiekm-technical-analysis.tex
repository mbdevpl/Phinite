\subsection{Main menu}
Main menu contains all general options that are required to be implemented, but are not connected
with a specific step of calculation. Contents of the menu must not change during application
operation, but its certain entries may be temporarily disabled during some phases of computation.

Main menu will contain, ex. exit option, %load option, 
example selection option.

\subsection{Main area}
Main area will contain frequently changing content, as it may have any of the following: a text
field for entering a regular expression, button to proceed to the next step of computation, button
to abort computation, button to display final result, a table with intermediate results, a final
result, etc. Content of main area depends on context, i.e. previous actions of the user and current
status of application.

\subsection{Status bar}
Status bar must contain one of three phrases at all times, unless there are equivalent indicators
implemented (mentioned in each point):
\begin{itemize}

  \item ``busy'' - if program computes the final or intermediate result. %, or is loading data.
  
  Equivalent of this is locking all elements of the GUI while the program is busy.

  \item ``awaiting user interaction'' - if program is not busy, but intends to be right after user
  gives some information that may help with further computation. The phrase may be changed to other
  with the same meaning. This status is intended only for computation phase, and only for those
  parts of computation phase that require user input.
  
  Equivalent of this status is displaying a new window. All information and input fields needed by
  the user to help the program must be in this new window. When it is closed, program resumes
  computation.
  
  Since the user feedback mechanism is optional (provided that it is of course substituted with
  working implementation), in certain implementation scenarios this status will never occur (or
  window will never be shown). If development team is able to prove that this feature would really
  never be used, this status indication does not have to be implemented.

  \item ``ready'' - in all other situations, for example: after start-up, %after loading the data,
  after completing the computation.
  
  Equivalent of this status is a situation in which both previous mechanisms are implemented using
  second variant. If it is so, this status can be omitted.

\end{itemize}

Status bar may also temporarily contain some optional content that may help the user in completing
the user interaction phase, provided that the main area is not a proper place for this content.
