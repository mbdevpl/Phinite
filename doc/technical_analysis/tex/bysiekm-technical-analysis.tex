\section*{Abstract}

\writehere

\section{The runtime environment}

This section provides a set of requiremets with regard to the environment, in which the developed
program will be run.

\subsection*{Definition}

\begin{itemize}

  \item \textit{the application} is a synonym for \titletext, the term includes the runtime of
  \titletext with the documentation, but not the source code.

\end{itemize} 

\subsection{Hardware requirements}

The computer on which the application is run must conform with the minimum requirements that are
defined for operating system and the components listed in further sections. The application itself
must require at most 1GB of hard drive space and 1GB of RAM to work. The actual implementation does
not have to use all the available space, but it must work within the boundaries.

\subsection{Operating system}

Application is expected to work on the following set of operating systems:

\begin{itemize}

  \item Microsoft Windows 7 Professional x86

  \item Microsoft Windows 7 Professional x64

  \item Microsoft Windows 7 Ultimate x86

  \item Microsoft Windows 7 Ultimate x64

\end{itemize} 

\subsection{Software present in the system}

Other than the operating system, application cannot be expected to work corretly unless all of the
following components are present in the operating system:

\begin{itemize}

  \item .NET Framework 4.0 Full Profile

  \item PDF (Portable Document Format) file viewer

  \item PDF-LaTeX creation toolkit that is able to create PDF files from LaTeX source code using
  command-line.

\end{itemize} 

The application may seem to work correctly without some of these components being present, but it is
undefined what will happen.

\section{Development process constraints}

This section provides a set of requiremets with regard to the environment, in which the application
and its documentation will be developed.

\subsection*{Definition}

\begin{itemize}

  \item \textit{the project} is term used for all of the listed: the runtime of \titletext{} with the
  documentation, the source code and required external libraries.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Developing the application}

\begin{itemize}

  \item Visual Studio 2012 Ultimate will be used
  
  \item C\# will be used to implement the algorithms used to fulfil the main purpose of
  \titletext{}: for building finite-state machine that is equivalent to a given regular expression
  and for simulating machine's evaluation of a given word

  \item WPF (Windows Presentation Framework) will be used to create the user interface, via use of
  C\# and XAML

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Source code documentation}

\begin{itemize}

  \item All namespaces introduced in the development process have to be documented. 

  \item All classes, interfaces and enumerated types have to be at least briefly described. 

  \item All public properites and UI event handlers also have to be documented.

  \item The source code documentation will follow the standard C\# documentation rules, because the
  Visual Studio has built-in support for creation of such documentation.

  \item Where the rules of C\# documentation are not enough, the doxygen documentation format can be
  used: ex. to group classes into modules, to document namespaces, etc.

  \item Doxygen will be used to process the source code to create a set of web pages (which use HTML
  and CSS) with the complete documentation.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{The development}

The list of technologies for the runtime applies also to this section. Moreover, there are some
extra components used exclusively for the development.

\section{GUI mockup}

  \caption{schema of the graphical user interface}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Main menu}
Main menu contains all general options that are required to be implemented, but are not connected
with a specific step of calculation. Contents of the menu must not change during application
operation, but its certain entries may be temporarily disabled during some phases of computation.

Main menu will contain, ex. exit option, %load option, 
example selection option.

\subsection{Main area}
Main area will contain frequently changing content, as it may have any of the following: a text
field for entering a regular expression, button to proceed to the next step of computation, button
to abort computation, button to display final result, a table with intermediate results, a final
result, etc. Content of main area depends on context, i.e. previous actions of the user and current
status of application.

\subsection{Status bar}
Status bar must contain one of three phrases at all times, unless there are equivalent indicators
implemented (mentioned in each point):
\begin{itemize}

  \item ``busy'' - if program computes the final or intermediate result. %, or is loading data.
  
  Equivalent of this is locking all elements of the GUI while the program is busy.

  \item ``awaiting user interaction'' - if program is not busy, but intends to be right after user
  gives some information that may help with further computation. The phrase may be changed to other
  with the same meaning. This status is intended only for computation phase, and only for those
  parts of computation phase that require user input.
  
  Equivalent of this status is displaying a new window. All information and input fields needed by
  the user to help the program must be in this new window. When it is closed, program resumes
  computation.
  
  Since the user feedback mechanism is optional (provided that it is of course substituted with
  working implementation), in certain implementation scenarios this status will never occur (or
  window will never be shown). If development team is able to prove that this feature would really
  never be used, this status indication does not have to be implemented.

  \item ``ready'' - in all other situations, for example: after start-up, %after loading the data,
  after completing the computation.
  
  Equivalent of this status is a situation in which both previous mechanisms are implemented using
  second variant. If it is so, this status can be omitted.

\end{itemize}

Status bar may also temporarily contain some optional content that may help the user in completing
the user interaction phase, provided that the main area is not a proper place for this content.

\section{Classes}
This section goes through the most important classes used in the project.

\subsection{RegularExpression}

\begin{verbatim}
class RegularExpression
{
	string input;
	
	List<string, Tag> taggedInput;
	
	PartialExpression parsedInput;
}

\subsection{PartialExpression}

\begin{verbatim}
class PartialExpression
{
	Role role;
